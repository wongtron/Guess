# Guess

In summer 2016, I took a 3-month "Android App and Java Development" training at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei, and this class was sponsored by the Labor Department of the Taiwan government.

One class I took is to develop Android Apps with the Android Studio IDE. 

Teacher Hank Tom assigned us a homework to develop an Android App to do the following:

Create a random number between 1 and 10. Allow the user to guess the number either with unlimited number of guesses, or to limit the number of guesses to three times.

The code to implement this Android App is included in this repository.

The teacher also asked us to implement this assignment as a web application using the browser, Java servlet, and JSP.  The code for the web application implementation is included in the 'GuessAgain" repository.

Even though this Android App is simple, but for me it is the first App that I implemented independently.  For previous Apps, basicaly I copied the sample code from the teacher or from the book, and I did not give too much thought on them.  For this App, I have to implement everything from scratch, and that is quite an experience.

I incorporated many of the components that I learned in class at that time into this App:

   - TextView
   - EditText
   - Button
   - Option menu
   - Incorporate image icons in the Toast message to show the number is guessed correctly, or number of guesses reaches limit
